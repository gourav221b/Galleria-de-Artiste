                            <p> What is love, the question comes to my mind,<br> Whose answer I still try to find.<br> Is it only an abstract, that <br> Can keep you off your track?<br> Or is it a feeling that two friends share<br> Even when nothing is there.<br>                                I dont know ,what you mean by love.<br> Because still, I can't control my heart.<br> Is love something,that changes your nature<br> By the beauty of the persons personal features? <br> Or is it something that makes you
                                life,
                                <br> It is the choice of the Almighty's dice.<br> Love is a feeling that most of us mistake <br> For passion towards others, that you say.</p>

                            <p><br>You dont know what is love,<br> As it is something you've not got.<br> Is love only beside some lakes?<br> Or under Victoria's full grown length? <br> Or is it in your mind's deepest corners,<br> That is impervious- an
                                unbreakable dimension.<br> Love is something you won't understand <br> As you have not seen it nor observed.<br> I know, what is love, because I have seen it,<br> Observed and felt it.</p>

                            <p>When everything else was doomed, it <br> Was love that had my life bloomed.<br> It was love that gave me power, <br> When everything else was washed out of my area.<br> There is a difference between love and affair, <br> I
                                wont tell you as you don't care.<br> I love someone who perhaps loves me not, but perhaps hates me,<br> Anyway fate is in my favour.<br> If she loves me ,I am in her heart.<br> If she hates me, I am in her mind.<br> The
                                answer as to what is love, is <br> Something you can never find.<br>

                            <p>What we see is false,<br> What we hear are rumours and laments,<br> What we feel has no truth<br> Because everyone have their secrets to hide.</p>

                            <p>You think you know someone.<br> You think she is the one.<br> But seldom do you know that <br> Even she has her secrets.</p>

                            <p>You feel sad ,you are down,<br> You think you are an open book,<br> But even you yourself have your own <br> Secrets to hide.</p>

                            <p>Life can loose all its meaning, <br> Speech can loose its strength, <br> The body will slowly grow weak,<br> And you will be all alone.<br> Your mind will wander off,<br> And will hardly ever return.</p>

                            <p>Life may seem strange,<br> Everyone you know will be a stranger,<br> You will think you dont care,<br> But it is you who cares the most.</p>

                            <p>Every single man has a mask on,<br> You can't judge who is who,<br> No one will be there by your side <br> Because, everyone has their secrets to hide.
                            </p>

                            <p>She sat in the corner,<br> Visible to all,<br> Yet unnoticed.<br>
                                <em>Why is she always alone?</em><br> Some wondered.</p>

                            <p> She came and went,<br> Sitting silently, talking to no one.<br>
                                <em>Why doesn‚Äôt she talk to anyone?</em><br> Some wondered.</p>

                            <p>She kept to herself,<br> Had an impassive face.<br> She was not popular,<br> Neither a social outcast.<br> But she was not approached,<br> Neither was she asked for help.<br>
                                <em>Is she arrogant?<br>
                                Does she think herself to be superior?<br>
                                Is she proud and haughty?<br>
                                Does she have an ego?</em><br> Everyone wondered.</p>

                            <p>One day, like everyday,<br> She came, sat in silence.<br> Impassive face and alone,<br> She sat in her corner,<br> And she sat went, like always,<br> Unnoticed.
                                <br> Next day, she had become Invisible,<br> And then noticed.<br> Everyone wondered,<br> Why she did it?<br>
                                <em>Have we made her do it?<br>
                                Did she really wanted to do it?</em></p>

                            <p>Slowly past images of her flowed,<br> Memories were shared,<br> She was being remembered.<br> Thoughts voiced,<br> Views opined,<br> Now she was Remembered,<br> And Noticed,<br> But after Death took her away.<br>

                            <p>She never knew how I felt.<br> Didn't hope that to be.<br> I had feelings,<br> Long ago though.<br> Now I wanted friendship.</p>

                            <p>Tried to explain that to her.<br> "Sorry" she thought.<br> And now out of oblivion, she doesn't speak to me.<br> And me. Being here, and no where to be.</p>

                            <p>As I sit here, wondering what the hell to do,<br> "Writing a poem" is all that I am compelled to do.</p>

                            <p>"Goodbye" should I say or stay just quiet.</p>

                                <br> A Strange calmness reigned over.<br> I tried to get angry, But peace suddenly triumphed .<br> It felt numb. But even after everything,<br> I tell myself.

                            <p>You look into the mirror, hoping to see the better you,<br> You relate to characters of fiction, hoping to strengthen you.<br> You put your faith in God, realising He is the true one.<br> You look at yourself, wanting to do
                                better.
                            </p>

                            <p> You think you‚Äôre the best, also that you‚Äôre no good.<br> You get mixed feelings, by none other than you.<br> You look at people, you browse, through everything,<br> Hoping to get some inspiration, but no luck.<br> Maybe it‚Äôs
                                not your day, maybe it‚Äôs a bad year.<br> All you need probably is a good win.</p>

                            <p>There‚Äôs a thing, that you don‚Äôt realize, <br> The fire in you is real.<br> You tame it, like it‚Äôs fake, like you need a real one.<br> All you look for in the mirror, is Validation.<br> The fire burns, in all its glory, waiting
                                to erupt.<br> The ink in your pain dries eventually, <br> Hoping you will pick it up.<br> The typewriter is now dusty, all it needs is a brush<br> The one‚Äôs validation you seek for, isn‚Äôt the one you should trust.</p>

                            <p>So look in the mirror, see for yourself, Look for who you really are,<br> Some validation needing person, or the strong one with the fire .<br> Rise up and shine, for the world hasnt come to an end.<br> All you should need
                                is to trust a true friend.<br>
